# Test-Driven Development in Game Programming

## What is TDD?
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual implementation code. The cycle follows these steps:

1. **Write a test** that defines a function or improvements of a function
2. **Run the test** - it should fail since the function isn't implemented yet
3. **Write the simplest code** that passes the test
4. **Run the test** again - it should pass now
5. **Refactor** the code for better structure while ensuring tests still pass
6. **Repeat** the process for new features

## TDD in Game Development

### Special Considerations
- **Separate logic from rendering**: Test game logic independently from rendering code
- **Use dependency injection**: Make it easy to swap real systems with test doubles
- **Deterministic systems**: Ensure game systems produce predictable outputs for given inputs
- **Component isolation**: Test individual components before integration

### What to Test in Games
1. **Game mechanics**: Core gameplay rules and interactions
2. **Entity behavior**: How game objects respond to inputs and events
3. **Collision detection**: Accurate physics and interaction boundaries 
4. **Game state management**: Saving, loading, transitions between game states
5. **AI behaviors**: Decision making and pathfinding algorithms
6. **Resource management**: Handling of game assets and memory

### Example TDD Workflow for Game Feature

#### Adding a Player Health System:
1. Write test: `TestPlayerTakesDamage` - verify health decreases
2. Implement `Player` struct with health property and damage method
3. Write test: `TestPlayerDies` - verify player dies at 0 health
4. Implement death condition logic
5. Write test: `TestPlayerHealing` - verify healing mechanics
6. Implement healing logic
7. Refactor while ensuring all tests pass

### Tips for Effective Game TDD
- Use mocks for external systems (input, rendering, audio)
- Test edge cases (maximum values, boundary conditions)
- Create test scenarios that simulate real gameplay situations
- Use benchmarks for performance-critical code
- Implement automated test runs in your build process

## Testing Tools for Go Game Development
- Standard Go testing package (`testing`)
- Testify for more expressive assertions (`github.com/stretchr/testify`)
- Gomock for mocking dependencies (`github.com/golang/mock`)
- Testing coverage tool (`go test -cover`)

Remember: The goal of TDD is not just to have tests, but to drive better design through the testing process.
